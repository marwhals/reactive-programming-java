## Summary

### IO - Microservices Communication

Aggregate calls from multiple services

### Operators - Commonly used

### Operator - then

- Use when you are not interested in the result of a producer / chain multiple asynchronous calls to execute one by one!
- For example:
  - You are inserting a bunch of records into the DB. You jsut need to know if it is a success or not. Not the intermediate results.
